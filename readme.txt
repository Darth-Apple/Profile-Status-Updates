Welcome to the upcoming Github repository for the Profile Status Updates plugin! 

Development is nearing the beta-1 release and will be available very shortly. We will be tracking bugs and issues as development nears through this repository. 

Roadmap: 
Beta 1: Week of October 25th, 2020. A working branch will be available on Github with all planned features implemented and major, known issues resolved. This beta will enable widespread testing and further development. We DO NOT recommend this beta to be installed on live forums, as we will not be preparing an upgrade path from beta 1 to beta 2. 

Beta 2:  Some issues will be marked for beta 2, allowing us to take care of critical issues for the first beta release. 

Beta 3 and Release Candidates: These releases will be live-forum safe. We intend to have live-forum safe versions of this plugin available for a period of time before the official release, which will be labeled beta 3 or otherwise. This allows the final plugin to be stable and fully tested before we push to the official MyBB plugin repository. 

Please stay tuned. The official beta 1 release will be arriving in the coming days! :)
